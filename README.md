# Multi-Agent-Planners
Implementation of various path planners for dynamic environments.
This was written for a graduate course project and thus was never meant to be super readable (sorry). 

Planners implemented include:
- DRRT,
- DRRT*
- RRTX,
- Velocity Obstacles.


The multi-agent experiment scripts for running each planner on 4 separate robots can be found within the 'testing' folder. Also included in that folder is a script to run a single-robot version of a selected planner.

The implementations (classes) of each planner can be found within the 'algorithms' folder.


Example of 4 robots trying to navigate around each other using DRRT* :
